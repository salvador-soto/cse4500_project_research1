## Check in 3
For this check in I decided to experiment a little, I wanted to practice and try to make a website that I can change the colors of the background by either clicking a button or based on mouse position.I decided to try and do this because for one of the ideas for the term project I thought it would be cool if I could have several colors inside of each other in a way that they looked stacked, so it would emulate depth, and having a character traversing through this "color tunnel" of sorts. So I needed to figure out a way to change colors in the background first and this is what I managed to do.
